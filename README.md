# SMART Fridge
This is a project for a SMART Fridge, which facilitates the process of tracking of the stock and the maintenance as well.
# System Description

The goal of our project is to implement a SMART Fridge. With our Embedded system, it is much easier for shop owners to **keep track of the capacity** of the products. This is done by contacting the vendors and asking for product supply in case the shop/user has run out of enough stock. Our system also facilitates the maintenance procedures of the fridges, since it provides a sensor that makes sure that the temperature of the fridge is maintained to a certain acceptable value that will preserve the quality of the products stored inside it. We are also using telegram bot by which we can keep track of the system conditions. Moreover, we are using cayenne which is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams in the cloud, to maintain our system and provide support in case of malfunctions.
